    "description": "Agent Teams in Claude Code let you spin up multiple agents that work in parallel AND communicate with each other - and that changes everything about how you build with AI. But here's the thing: if you just throw a vague prompt at an agent team, you're going to get a mess - guaranteed.\n\nIn this video, I do a full live build of a Chargebee payment integration on top of an existing app using Claude Code Agent Teams. I walk through the entire process - priming the agent on the codebase, having it ask me questions to reduce its assumptions, creating a structured plan, and then sending that plan into a team of 3 agents working in parallel. Plus I show you the contract-first approach that makes agent teams actually reliable, and end-to-end browser validation that catches every issue before control passes back to you.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you're looking to build a payment integration into your applications, check out Chargebee!\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/chargebee-payments\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- The Dynamous Agentic Coding Course is now FULLY released - learn how to build reliable and repeatable systems for AI coding: \nhttps://dynamous.ai/agentic-coding-course\n\n- Here is the branch with my final implementation:\nhttps://github.com/coleam00/agentic-chat-application-template/tree/feature/chargebee-token-billing\n\n- Claude Code Agent Teams documentation:\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n0:00 Introduction to Claude Code Agent Teams\n3:49 What We're Building Today\n7:50 The Planning and Priming Process\n11:22 Getting Our Agent to Ask Questions (Very Powerful)\n18:12 Creating the Structured Plan\n31:01 Implementing with Parallel Agents (Our Team)\n40:45 End-to-End Browser Validation\n48:00 Final Demo\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI.

    "description": "If your agents can't use a browser, you're still doing MANUAL WORK that should have been automated YESTERDAY. \ud83d\udd25\n\nStop typing URLs, clicking buttons, and babysitting test suites. Your agents should be doing that FOR you, in parallel, while you focus on what actually matters.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 VIDEO REFERENCES\n\u2022 Bowser Codebase: https://github.com/disler/bowser\n\u2022 Playwright CLI (Microsoft): https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli\n\u2022 Claude Code Chrome Docs: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/chrome\n\nPUSH YOUR AGENTIC CODING BEYOND\nTactical Agentic Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/tactical-agentic-coding?y=efctPj6bjCY\n\n\ud83d\ude80 In this video, we break down a complete 4-layer agentic browser automation stack built for real engineering work. From automating Amazon shopping workflows to spinning up parallel UI testing agents across Hacker News, this is browser automation and UI testing done the agentic way. No fluff, no toy demos. Watch Claude Code fire up real browsers, execute real tasks, and report back with screenshots and pass/fail results.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Here's the stack: Layer 1 is Skills, the foundational capability layer where Playwright CLI and Claude Code Chrome give your agents the raw ability to control browsers. Layer 2 is Subagents, where you scale those skills into specialized, parallelized browser agents that can each tackle different user stories simultaneously. Layer 3 is Slash Commands, the orchestration layer where reusable prompts coordinate teams of subagents to run entire UI review suites or browser automation workflows. Layer 4 is Just, a powerful task runner that gives you one-command reusability across every layer of the stack.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Why agentic browser automation and agentic UI testing over traditional frameworks like Jest or Vitest? Because your agents operate like real users. No test configuration overhead. No brittle selectors. Just user stories, URLs, and agents that validate your application the way a human would, complete with screenshot trails for every step. And with parallel testing via Playwright CLI, you can run three, five, ten browser agents at once.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Key takeaways:\n\nSkills: The foundational capability layer. Playwright CLI gives you token-efficient, headless, parallel browser sessions. Claude Code Chrome lets you use your existing browser session for personal automation.\n\nSubagents: Scale your skills into specialized agents. Each subagent can run a different user story, a different workflow, or a different browser automation task in parallel.\n\nSlash Commands: The orchestration layer. Higher-order prompts and reusable commands let you coordinate agent teams, template your engineering, and trigger complex workflows with a single command.\n\nJust Files: The reusability layer. One place to call every workflow, every agent, every automation. Your team and your agents always know what's available.\n\nAgentic Engineering: Don't outsource learning how to build with agents. Master the skill, subagent, command, and reusability layers yourself. Specialization combined with scale is where the real leverage lives.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f The meta theme: solve entire CLASSES of problems, not just individual tasks. Template your engineering into repeat, opinionated solutions you can deploy across any codebase. Master the agent, master knowledge work.\n\nStay focused and keep building.\n\n#browserautomation #claudecode #agenticcoding",

    "description": "Claude Code, Cline, Aider, Codex CLI - every top AI coding tool has abandoned traditional RAG and embeddings. But for enterprise knowledge bases, RAG is a $2B market growing 50% per year, and it's ~100x cheaper per query than full context loading.\n\nSo is RAG dead or not? Both sides are right - they're just talking about different problems. Code is structured and perfectly searchable with grep. Business documents aren't. In this video I break down where the line is and what to use on each side.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe best way to learn to code is with Scrimba - start free and get 20% off the Pro plan:\n\n- Fullstack Developer Path (featured in this video): https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack?via=colemedin\n\n- All Scrimba coding courses (many free): \nhttps://scrimba.com/courses?via=colemedin\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- The Dynamous Agentic Coding Course is now FULLY released - learn how to build reliable and repeatable systems for AI coding: \nhttps://dynamous.ai/agentic-coding-course\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSources:\n\n- Boris Cherny / Claude Code on agentic search:\nhttps://smartscope.blog/en/ai-development/practices/rag-debate-agentic-search-code-exploration/\n\n- Why Cline doesn't use RAG for AI coding:\nhttps://pashpashpash.substack.com/p/why-i-no-longer-recommend-rag-for\n\n- LlamaIndex - Agentic Retrieval:\nhttps://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/rag-is-dead-long-live-agentic-retrieval\n\n- Aider repo map (Tree-sitter approach):\nhttps://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n0:00 Is RAG Dead?\n0:55 All Search is RAG (but not Semantic Search)\n1:52 Structured vs. Unstructured Data\n4:09 Why RAG Fails for Code\n6:22 Scrimba\n7:29 Agentic Search in Practice\n11:05 When to Use Traditional RAG\n13:12 Bridging Both Retrieval Strategies\n14:35 Final Thoughts\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJoin me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI.

Kintsugi is a free Agentic Development Environment (ADE) built on top of Claude Code by the team at Sonar (makers of SonarQube).

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nFull Story w/ Prompts: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/codex-53-vs-opus-46-two-agent-philosophies?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n_______________________________________\nWhat's really happening when two competing visions of AI agents ship 20 minutes apart? The common story is that this is a benchmark race\u2014but the reality is more complicated when the choice between Codex and Claude determines how your entire week changes.\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on why OpenAI and Anthropic built fundamentally different answers to the same question:\n\n \u2022 Why Codex bets on autonomous correctness while Claude bets on integration and coordination\n \u2022 How the three-layer orchestrator architecture enables hand-it-off-and-walk-away work\n \u2022 What Agent Teams with peer-to-peer messaging means for interdependent problems\n \u2022 Where the meta-skill of evaluating new capabilities becomes the durable advantage\n\nFor knowledge workers choosing between delegation-shaped problems and coordination-shaped problems, the right question is not which tool wins\u2014it's which organizational muscle you want to build.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
